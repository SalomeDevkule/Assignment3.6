1)Method Overloading with same return types.
The concept of method overloading depends on 2 things-1)method name and 2)signature
It means using same method name with different signatures.
However, using same return type is not an issue here. 
So it is possible to overload methods with same return type.
For example,
Consider 2 methods where 1st is to find area of circle and other is to find area of rectangle.
Here the return type could be int for both the methods with different number of arguments.

int area(int radius) //for circle
int area(int length, int breadth) //for rectangle
